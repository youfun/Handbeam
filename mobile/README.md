# Handbeam Native Chat experiment

Mob 0.7.39 native controls. Android renders Jetpack Compose; iOS renders
SwiftUI. The chat and settings pages no longer embed LiveView or WebView.
Handbeam runs on-device unchanged: Coordinator owns input, Runner owns tasks,
and ConversationTranscriptStore owns history. Phoenix remains available on
loopback for existing runtime services.

Implemented: text chat, streamed replies, tool status, stop, new/history chats,
notification conversation routing; add/edit provider/model, HTTPS base URL,
API protocol and masked API key input, workspace default model and reasoning.
Other settings and attachments are explicit placeholders. Markdown, OAuth login,
model deletion and workspace management are not part of this experiment.

API keys use the existing app-private `models.json` storage (not Keystore).
Existing keys are never prefilled, and blank edits retain them. Provider edits
affect every model belonging to that provider. No credentials are imported from
the original app.

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

```bash
cd mobile
mix deps.get
mix test
```

## Android

Independent package: `com.example.handbeam_probe.nativechat` (launcher: **Handbeam**).
Does not replace or share data with `com.example.handbeam_probe`.
Debug node: `:"handbeam_probe_android_nativechat@127.0.0.1"`, Dist **9200**.
Inspect handlers using `Mob.Test` / `:rpc`; screenshots verify layout only.

ChromeOS ARC cannot `run-as`. Persist OTP with `mix mob.pack_apk --device arc:5555`,
then force-stop **only the nativechat package** and start
`com.example.handbeam_probe.nativechat/com.example.handbeam_probe.MainActivity`.

Pack debug APKs (one ABI per zip; same script locally and in CI):

```bash
cd mobile
bash script/pack_android_apks.sh                  # arm64-v8a + x86_64
bash script/pack_android_apks.sh --abi arm64-v8a  # phones
```

Android Git uses ExGit's NDK CMake build (`ex_git` is a mobile Mix dependency,
not a root production dependency). Gradle packages `libex_git_nif.so`
with static libgit2 and Mbed TLS; no device Git CLI is required. App startup
sets `Handbeam.Host` `:git_backend` to `Handbeam.Git.ExGit`, the installed
native-library path, and the existing CA bundle before NIF load. TLS
certificate validation stays enabled.

After a cold start, verify local Git and public HTTPS clone/fetch/pull without
an LLM or credentials (the script removes its disposable workspace):

```bash
adb -s <device> forward tcp:9200 tcp:9200
adb -s <device> reverse tcp:4369 tcp:4369
epmd -daemon
mix run --no-start script/android_git_smoke.exs
```

The smoke also checks that a self-signed HTTPS certificate is rejected.
It needs access to GitHub and `self-signed.badssl.com`.

## iOS

Same Mix package (`:handbeam_probe`) and the same `HomeScreen` / Coordinator /
Runner. Host tree is `ios/` (SwiftUI + `handbeam_ios` NIF). Bundle id:
`com.example.handbeam_probe` (launcher: **HandbeamProbe**). Needs macOS, Xcode, and
the Zig pin used by Mob native (see `.tool-versions`).

```bash
cd mobile
mix ios.native                         # Simulator; alias for mob.deploy --native --ios
mix ios.native --device <udid>         # a specific simulator or device
```

`mix ios` is BEAM-only (`mob.deploy --ios`). Prefer `mix ios.native` for a
full host rebuild.

Simulator Dist cookie is `:mob_secret`. Node name is
`:"handbeam_probe_ios_<8-char-udid>@127.0.0.1"` (first 8 hex chars of the UDID,
lowercase, no dashes). Bare `:"handbeam_probe_ios@127.0.0.1"` is only the
fallback when no UDID is known. `mix mob.connect` often hangs; ping from a
named node instead:

```elixir
node = :"handbeam_probe_ios_8d4e9af7@127.0.0.1"   # example; match the booted sim
Node.ping(node)
Mob.Test.screen(node)
Mob.Test.assigns(node)
```

Photo pick, export open/share, and in-app file preview run through
`HandbeamProbe.Platform.IOS` (controlled import, snapshot registry, stock Mob
nodes). Tests must not load Android NIFs; iOS NIF failures stay errors, not
`:ok`.
