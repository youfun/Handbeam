defmodule Handbeam.Platform.ProcessSandboxTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Failure list for the OS sandbox boundary (written before the macOS backend).

  Inputs and required outcomes:

    1. Seatbelt profile text never contains a caller-supplied path; every path
       reaches `sandbox-exec` only through `-D NAME=value` parameters.
    2. The profile denies all file writes by default and re-allows only the
       workspace, the private temp dir, declared extra paths, and fixed /dev nodes.
    3. Signals may only target processes in the same sandbox.
    4. Extra writable paths: `~` is expanded, symlinks are resolved, missing or
       non-directory paths are dropped, and `/` or the home directory itself are
       rejected because they would void the boundary.
    5. macOS wrapping resolves symlinks (`/tmp` -> `/private/tmp`) before passing
       the workspace, because Seatbelt matches real paths.
    6. Paths containing quotes, parentheses, or spaces are passed verbatim as
       parameters and cannot alter the profile.
    7. A missing sandbox executable or a missing workspace fails closed; it never
       falls back to an unconfined shell.
    8. The private temp dir lives outside the workspace and outside the host's
       shared temp dir root, and is exported as TMPDIR.

  Behavioural checks against the real OS sandbox are tagged `:os_sandbox`.
