  # Failure list. 198.18.0.0/15 is not a public destination.
  # 1. Hostname answers are only 198.18/15 and takeover is :none → error, no dial.
  # 2. The same answers with takeover :tun → dial that token, not a rewritten public IP.
  # 3. The same answers with a system HTTP proxy and no TUN → dial {:proxy, ...}
  #    with the hostname. The token is not the dial target.
  # 4. Literal 198.18/15, loopback, private and metadata hosts stay rejected
  #    even when takeover is :tun. A lying resolver cannot launder them.
  # 5. A redirect to a private host or literal is rejected and not dialed.
  # 6. Mixed fake-ip and public, or fake-ip and private, is rejected.
  # 7. Public answers stay pinned and do not consult takeover.
  # 8. A default or physical route is not TUN ownership. A /15 via utun is.
  #    An HTTP(S) proxy URL is a proxy. socks5:// is not.
  # 9. A resolver that returns only 198.18/15 for an unrelated name is Fake-IP
  #    and may dial the token. A public, mixed, empty, or failed canary is not.
