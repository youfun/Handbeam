defmodule Handbeam.Git.Credentials do
  @moduledoc """
  Resolves opaque Git credential names at execution time, outside model input.

  Hosts configure `:handbeam, :git_credentials` as a map of names to keyword
  lists containing `:endpoint`, `:password` and optional `:username`.
  Fresh authentication challenges must match the HTTPS endpoint. libgit2
  blocks cross-host redirects and HTTPS downgrades, but may reuse credentials
  on other HTTPS ports or paths of the same hostname. Configuration therefore
  trusts every HTTPS service on that hostname, not just one port or repository.
  Never load this map from agent-controlled workspace settings.
