  Loop owner for an external CLI agent.

  One turn has one loop owner. `Handbeam.Agent.Turn` remains the default: it
  calls a Provider and Handbeam executes tools. A CLI session is the other
  owner. Handbeam opens the session, sends the user message, and projects
  normalized events. It does not call `Handbeam.Agent.Provider`, attach
  Handbeam tool definitions, or re-execute the CLI's tool events.

  Backends implement this behaviour. Callers depend on `id/0` and the
  normalized events below, never on a backend's wire protocol.
